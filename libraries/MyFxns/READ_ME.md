Contains collection of functions for use with redboard. 

there are currently some functions that may not be reuired. 


Improvements to come

Need to make a couple quick functions to convert power to % and reverse it. also add RPM to percent and back.


Plans:
May use the button to output override the joystick output derate the value of the motor to something similar to preset values created by the potentiometer.

Still need the timer function into the header file so that the interrupt may function from simple command in the program.
